                <p><em>How to build, nurture and understand the creation of a community cult(ure) in web3.</em></p>

                <p>Web2 products and communities are largely built on para social relationships. Users expend energy and effort on a product or experience and in return the app (or company) gains your valuable, commodifiable data & attention. This is largely a one way relationship transaction.</p>

                <p>The difference in relationship between a web2 and a web3 product is web3's ability to incentivize mediated social relationships, which are based on give and take rather than a one way transaction.</p>

                <p>This web3 user<>product relationship is built on continuous participation & intellectual hypothecation, defined as the construction & dissemination of cultural meaning (intellectual work) using brand identity as a medium.</p>

                <p>Moving from para social to a mediated social relationship creates a symbiotic environment; users & participants are renumerated, rewarded and revered via accumulated reputation and acknowledgement within web3 network. The work users do and the rewards products and users receive form the basis of a memetic community cult.</p>

                <p>This dynamic has arguably not existed in the online world before. Memetic cults of personality are nothing new. However, web3's ability to commodify and codify these cults in a network is a genuinely novel & continually evolving paradigm. It is why memetic community cults as a function of successful Web3 companies are so important.</p>

                <p>The use and understanding of this new cultural paradigm is under leveraged. The framework below is an attempt at parlaying a well understood modern political science theory in a Web3 context; a framework to understand (and build) strong Web3 Communities.</p>

                <h3>Embeddedness in Digital Culture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of <em>entrenched, culturally significant memes</em> in communications across social channels demonstrates a modicum of understanding and familiarity with an established, valued culture. It is a source of legitimacy and understanding; attained purely via use of established semiotics.</li>
                    <li>Meeting your 'community' and establishing a presence where users congregate via <em>participation in Crypto Twitter, Discord and Telegram</em> signifies a willingness to establish relationships beyond that of the para-social. This signification is essential when establishing and building a community. A community cannot engage or grow without this presence.</li>
                    <li>The <em>use of GM (or a variation)</em> is an acknowledgment. Recognition a connectedness beyond the barriers separating them - it's an acknowledgment of presence, despite (or in spite) of users' engagement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Glorification of the underlying technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A product has to offer a <em>clear, recognized technological improvement open to all</em>. This is a cornerstone cultural concept within web3 - technological benefit and open participation as a public good is essential.</li>
                    <li>Web3 technology at its core is a promise of <em>even newer ways of doing things</em>. New user experiences and consumer products are an exciting, alluring prospect.</li>
                    <li>The promise of Web3 is a <em>paradigm shift.</em> The reformatting and restructuring of political and economic boundaries; inclusive of everyone willing to participate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Alteration of brand signifiers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The creation and use of <em>branded variations of culturally significant internet memes</em> demonstrates an innate understanding of the cultural landscape and language. Their creation allows unique & compelling narrative structures to form around brands and communities.</li>
                    <li>Leveraging variations of culturally significant memes clears the way to establishing a <em>clear, consistent and aligned brand voice</em> which then serves as a foundation for community to build on.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Rituals and Symbols</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leveraging the use and adoption of rituals and symbols creates a <em>strengthened brand image with unique framing.</em> A brands strength is directly related to the communities diversity and the strength of that communities ideas via various cultural frames.</li>
                    <li>Community diversity requires brands to <em>lean into social and cultural change.</em> Failure to do so leads to disenfranchisement and a stagnation of cultural identity.</li>
                    <li>Modernity is a painful, often confusing existence. People who spend large portions of their time online satirize <em>being sad/cringe/lonely</em> as an ironic but painful reality. Acknowledgment of this is empowering in a culture that embraces a social and economic paradigm shift.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The memetic brand doppelganger</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Continued and varied use of memes <em>frames the brand with certain values and styles.</em> These values and styles form the cultural basis of a communities identity, which constantly evolves new meaning.</li>
                    <li>At a certain point, <em>memes become recognizable independent of their original branding or meaning</em>. They carry with them parts of the formational culture, but take on lives of their own.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Thanks for reading - I hope this has in some way illuminated what makes a web3 community. I will (eventually) expand on these ideas to give people a better understanding of how to execute these principles, provide concrete examples of each and techniques people can use to put them to work in their own web3 communities.</p>

                <p>Until next time.</p>
